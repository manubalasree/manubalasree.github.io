Welcome! I'm starting this blog to share practical knowledge from my experience working with Linux systems, SRE practices, and cloud infrastructure.

## What You'll Find Here

**Troubleshooting Walkthroughs**
Real-world debugging sessions: tracking down memory leaks, diagnosing network issues, investigating production incidents.

**Linux Deep Dives**
Performance tuning, kernel parameters, systemd, networking internals, and security hardening.

**Infrastructure & Automation**
Terraform patterns, Ansible playbooks, Kubernetes operations, and CI/CD pipelines that actually work in production.

**SRE Practices**
Building observability, writing meaningful SLOs, on-call strategies, and incident postmortem templates.

## Coming Up

Some posts I'm planning:

- Debugging high CPU usage on a production Linux server
- Setting up Prometheus and Grafana for infrastructure monitoring
- Terraform patterns for multi-environment deployments
- Linux performance tools every SRE should know

Thanks for visiting!
