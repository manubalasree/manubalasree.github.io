I'm a Site Reliability Engineer and Cloud Architect with 18 years of experience building and scaling infrastructure across diverse environments. Currently working in London, Ontario, I specialize in AWS infrastructure, Kubernetes, automation, and cost optimization.

## Impact & Scale

Over my career, I've:
- Delivered **$500K+ in documented infrastructure savings** through optimization and automation
- Managed **thousands of VMs** across multi-cloud environments spanning multiple time zones
- Led technology adoption initiatives through working prototypes rather than theoretical proposals
- Built production-grade observability platforms and implemented blue-green deployment strategies

## Technical Journey

My relationship with Linux began in late 1990s Trivandrum, Kerala, where I was active member of Trivandru Linux users group promoting the use of opensource software in the community.

Linux remains my "first love" - the foundation that informs everything I build.

## Current Focus

- Kubernetes and cloud-native architectures
- Infrastructure as Code and GitOps practices
- Observability and performance optimization
- Systems design at scale
- Staff-level SRE practices and leadership

## Beyond Work

I live in London, Ontario with my family and our mini Australian Shepherd. I co-host a [Malayalam storytelling podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2AKdjPwTQPV6xYXW82xkux) with my spouse, and find clarity through meditative walks while thinking through complex technical problems.
